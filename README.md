# Svelte ecommerce app

Responsive design template and basic frontend functionality for an ecommerce app built in [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte). I really started this project to try my hand out at Svelte and it was an absolute blast. The project is deployed on [Netlify](https://kind-davinci-0e6394.netlify.com/).

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
